      <h3>More about me</h3>
      <p>
        I am 31 years old and I live in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. My plant
        obsession started in 2018 when I finally managed to keep 3 plants alive
        and kicking. Soon after I just got more and more plants, learned which
        ones thrive in my care and which ones aren't for me. This is also where
        I learned that (most) Philodendrons are my favourite type of plant. My
        other main hobby is film photography. Yes, another expensive hobby. I
        shoot 35mm film on a Kodak m35 point-and-shoot or on a Nikon F-301. I'll
        put a link to my instagram page below if you're interested to see my
        photography. Furthermore I just love learning new things, spending time
        with my friends, reading a good book and watching TV shows and movies.
