      <h2>Learn more about my favourite species</h2>
      <p>
        Philodendron is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae.
        As of September 2015, the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families
        accepted 489 species;other sources accept different numbers. Regardless
        of number of species, the genus is the second-largest member of the
        family Araceae, after genus Anthurium. Taxonomically, the genus
        Philodendron is still poorly known, with many undescribed species. Many
        are grown as ornamental and indoor plants. The name derives from the
        Greek words philo- or "love, affection" and dendron or "tree". The
        generic name, Philodendron, is often used as the English name,
        "philodendron".

      <h2>Growing</h2>
      <p>
        Philodendrons can be grown outdoors in mild climates in shady spots.
        They thrive in moist soils with high organic matter. In milder climates,
        they can be grown in pots of soil or in the case of Philodendron
        oxycardium in containers of water. Indoor plants thrive at temperatures
        between 15 and 18 °C and can survive at lower light levels than other
        house plants.Although philodendrons can survive in dark places, they
        much prefer bright lights. Wiping the leaves off with water will remove
        any dust and insects. Plants in pots with good root systems will benefit
        from a weak fertilizer solution every other week.
      </p>
      <h2>Propagation</h2>
      <p>
        New plants can be grown by taking stem cuttings with at least two
        joints. Cuttings then can be rooted in pots of sand and peat moss
        mixtures. These pots are placed in greenhouses with bottom heat of 21–24
        °C. During the rooting, cuttings should be kept out of direct sunlight.
        Once rooted, the plants can be transplanted to larger pots or directly
        outside in milder climates. Stem cuttings, particularly from trailing
        varieties, can be rooted in water. In four to five weeks, the plant
        should develop roots and can be transferred to pots.
